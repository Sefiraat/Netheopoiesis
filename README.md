# Netheopoiesis

Netheopoiesis is our entry to the Slimefun Addon Jam 2022. Created by Sefiraat and J3fftw

This addon has three main aims:

- To bring life to the Nether, as per the Addon Jam's theme.
- To create the potential for players to be able to play both Vanilla Minecraft and Slimefun solely in the nether,
  should they choose to
- To make the nether a place suitable (and safe!) place to call home

***Notes for the Addon Jam specifically***

- Seed growth rate is multiplied 5x to speed up the process for judges
- Nether Crux spread rate is multiplied 5x also

A more detailed description of mechanics and details on plants can be found in my documentation
wiki [here](https://docs.sefiraat.dev/netheopoiesis/purification)

## Purification

The primary mechanic of this addon is the Purification system. When you place/grow certain items from this addon in the
nether, they will begin to lift the veil of darkness over the Nether in the surrounding area. This is the '
Purification Value'. Not only will the value increase but the blocks will change. These blocks become progressively more
lush as you progress.

As a chunk's purification value increases, you will be rewarded with things that are not normally possible in the
Nether:

- Being able to sleep in a bed!
- Being able to place water and grow new crops.
- Nether Mob spawns will slowly be replaced with overworld mobs, respecting the Nether's day/light cycle.
- Other Spawns will appear as the purification level gets higher including fish, random passive mobs and even wandering
  traders!
- Specific mobs will become friendly while in purified ground
- Bartering reaps greater rewards the higher the purification value
- Travel to the end using the Ender Cake
- Passive healing while in a purified region, increasing with the level of purification
- In the latter stages, you are able to go beyond just purification being able to:
    - Create overworld biomes in the Nether
    - Convert massive lava lakes into water

And more...

Purification begins by finding a Purification Seed. This seed will kick-start your journey in the nether as, when
placed, it will slowly begin to purify the surrounding blocks from Netherrack into Basic Purified Netherrack. Overtime
you will learn how to purify the Netherrack further into more rich soil types, each with an increasing effect on the
nearby purification value, leading us neatly into our second main mechanic...

## Seeds

The secondary mechanic is a vast plant growing/breeding system. Starting with 2 purification seeds next to one another (
with an air block between them) you can begin to breed cloned seeds and mutate new variants. These new variants each do
something unique from dropping materials, being harvestable for additional items, spawning mobs, pulsing beacon/potion
effects, growing trees and more.

As a bonus each seed will also add to the nearby purification value, with more complex-bred seeds providing more.

An in-depth breeding dictionary is available to keep track of discovered breeds and more detailed information about a
seed not initially available in the regular portion of the guide. Breeding requirements are hidden until the first time
you discover one, so watch out for in-game feedback, for example black particles mean the plants cannot breed, so you
best stop trying!

With a whopping 65 seeds currently available you'll have to do a lot of experimentation!

*Hint: Breeding a purifying seed with another of the same type is a good way to discover new seeds each time you find a
new one*

## Future Development

We had a lot of ideas for what we wanted to do here, but needed to keep the scope reasonable to ensure a completed
product would be ready for the end of the Jam, so here are a list of our planned features after the results of the Jam:

- A plant or other generation method for every overworld-only item
- Legitimate sky access in the most purified areas

## Credits

Big thank goes to GentlemanCheesy#2225 who made both the Viney and Spiney texture sets used for some plants within this
addon. He made them in a very short time frame and, for those who may not know, each color and each shade as they grow
had to be their own texture!
Even the Spawning heads made by me in this addon used his as a base so massive kudos to him :)
